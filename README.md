# CycloneDXDirectoryConverter
A buddy of mine was having trouble with the Cyclone CLI, so I whipped up a simple way for him to convert all files in a directory to CycloneDX json files.

This really was less than an hour of work, but it never hurts to share.

Requires the CLI from: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli

To use, just adjust the inDir, outDir, and cycloneAddress variables as needed.  It would be better if I added Command Line args, I might do so at some point when I have time.
